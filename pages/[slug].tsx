                  Second Deputy Governor of the Bank of Ghana, Elsie Addo Awadzi has underscored the need for more investments to be made in technology to ensure economic growth.
                  Madam Elsie Addo Awadzi believes though the COVID-19 pandemic gave rise to the use of technology, there are some gaps in access to it.
                  Delivering her speech as the Guest of honor at the 75th anniversary launch of the University of Ghana, Elsie Addo Awadzi urged current managers of the university to come up with more innovations and strategies to improve effective teaching and learning.
